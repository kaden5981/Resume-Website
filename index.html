    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p><section>
        <p>Hello! I’m Kaden Altomare, a passionate aspiring manufacturing mechanical engineer with four years of experience in CAD/CAM software (such as Autodesk Inventor and Fusion) and machining techniques. My competitive spirit has driven me to excel in various challenges, including my involvement in FIRST Robotics. As part of my local school's team, I had the incredible opportunity to help design a robot that made it to the FIRST Robotics World Championship in Dallas, Texas.</p>
        
        <p>In addition, I competed in SkillsUSA in the Automated Manufacturing competition, where our team earned a Gold medal in the state of Ohio and advanced to the national competition in Atlanta, Georgia, finishing in an impressive 6th place. These experiences honed my teamwork and leadership skills, allowing me to thrive in collaborative environments.</p>
        
        <p>When I’m not immersed in engineering projects, you can find me tinkering with my 3D printer at home, learning new software (such as MasterCam and Solidworks), hanging out with friends, enjoying the great outdoors, working on my car, or repairing anything I can get my hands on. I’m eager to leverage my skills in a challenging internship that allows me to contribute to innovative projects and continue learning in the field.</p>
        
        <p>Feel free to connect with me—I’d love to chat about engineering, robotics, or any exciting projects you have in mind!</p>
